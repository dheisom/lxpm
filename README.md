# LXPM

A simple Lite-XL plugin manager, this project is unofficial and in development.

It requires `curl` installed on your system!


# TODO

  - [x] (un)Install plugins
  - [x] (un)Install colors
  - [x] Support for packages(basic: only load a lua script from network)
  - [X] Support for list packages from [dheisom/lite-xl-packages](https://github.com/dheisom/lite-xl-packages)
